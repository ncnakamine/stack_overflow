# Summary
This project examines the relationship between learning mentality and network strength for developer career satisfaction. Basic statistics, OLS regression, and k-means clustering are used to answer the following questions: 
- To what extent do full time developers have a learning mentality? 
- To what extent do full time developers have a strong social network with other developers? 
- How do individual learning mentality and social network strength relate to career satisfaction?

- survey_results_public.csv.zip â€“ csv to reconstruct (and improve on) analyses

# Main findings:
- Full time developers have fairly high career satisfaction. 
- Learning mentality variables are relatively left skewed with more full time employed developer respondents favoring a learning mentality.
- NetworkStrength variables are relatively normally distributed when compared to LearningMentality variables, indicating less existence of strong networks than existence of learning mentality amongst respondents.
- LearningMentality variables are relatively more correlated with one another than NetworkStrength variables.
- With OLS regression, we observe that LearningMentality AND NetworkStrength variables are important for CareerSatisfaction
- If we create a more parsimonious model by creating aggregate variables for LearningMentality and NetworkStrength, we observe that LearningMentality has a more substantial relationship with CareerSatisfaction than NetworkStrength.
- Clustering LearningMentality and NetworkStrength allows us to label users according to these two aggregated dimensions.
- Networking learners appear to have the highest career satisfaction, followed by recluse learners, networking moderate-learners, then erratic networking anti-learners.
